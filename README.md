For this project we are going to use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)

To install it:

```bash
npm i -g pnpm
```

## Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm i
```

### Installing Pocketbase

Suppose you are running Linux or Windows subsystem for Linux(WSL)

Install `unzip` and `wget` to automate the installation of pocketbase by running `pb-setup.sh`

For users of other operating systems, please extract the pocketbase zip files in a directory called `pb`

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the next.js page.

Open [http://localhost:8090/\_](http://localhost:8090/_) with your browser to see the pocketbase admin UI.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Contributing

### Commit Message

To commit please follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) rules

This will provide a prompt to help you write good commit messages for us to handle. This will automatically run the git commit command for staged files.

#### IMPORTANT: ALL MESSAGE SHOULD BE LOWERCASE

### VSCode

If you want to commit in VSCode I highly recommend using this extension: [Conventional Commits](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemname=vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits)

You can access VSCode Conventional Commits in two ways:

1. `Command + Shift + P` or `Ctrl + Shift + P`, enter `Conventional Commits`,
   and press `Enter`.
2. Click the icon on the Source Control menu. See the image below.
